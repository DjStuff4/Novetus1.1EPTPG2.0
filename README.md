# A New Beginning.
I know what you're thinking. "Why is Dj Doing all of This? Why does he have to essentially make an entirely new project for a whole simple installer MADE to be easy?"

Well, You see.. On April 18th 2020, Drama Happened on an ORC Discord Server that drove me to leave it. Then, Toast made a terrible idea and it too me until he gave everybody admin in the OLD Server to realize it, and we seperated for a whole day. That evening, He emailed me saying the Whole Project is Open Source, and that it was goodbye.
Later the Next Day, I sent him a link to the new website that I hosted 2.0 on, and he dipped and asked for my discord again. I gave him it, and he came back for a while.

This GitHub Hosts both the original, and the newer files.

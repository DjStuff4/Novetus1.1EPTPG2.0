# A New Beginning.

-- READ HERE! --

As of June 2020, Phoenix has officially been killed off.
The code has been abandoned. Please feel free to use the remaining code to revive Phoenix.
You will need Splash Creativity (make sure to keep it under 45 characters or it might not display completely!), good patching skills, and stuff to add overtime.
You need InnoSetup to Re-Create the Installer (You may use my .iss files to remake the structure, or use your own custom installer).
If you want to play with Toast's Files, you need Visual Basic 2010 Express. I haven't tested with other editions.
If you want to see stuff that broke since we left Phoenix abandoned see [brokenstuff.md](https://github.com/DjStuff4/Novetus1.1EPTPG2.0/blob/master/brokenstuff.md)


-- ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION --

On April 18th 2020, Certain Drama and Actions forced me to leave. I wanted to preserve the files for the expansion. That's when 2.0 was born. These are the files for Phoenix. From the beginning before Phoenix, 1.0 through 1.6 (and 1.6.1), all the way to 2.0 releases.
Enjoy.

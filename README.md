# A New Beginning.

On April 18th 2020, Certain Drama and Actions forced me to leave. I wanted to preserve the files for the expansion. That's when 2.0 was Born. These are the files for Phoenix. From the beginning before Phoenix, 1.0 through 1.6 (and 1.6.1), all the way to 2.0 releases.
Enjoy.
Use InnoSetup 6 to play with the Studio Files.
Use Visual Studio 2010 to Play with Legacy Files.

2. README

This is a Lone Revival of what was the ashes of what remains of The Overhaul's Content/Installer. I've brought back every included file from 1.6, made a few changes, and I've revived the Project into a New Light, like a Phoenix. I've included several new goodies, Including the Original EULA/Errors and Changelog. I am sorry it had to end this way for the installer.
While the Installer was planned to be self coded in visual basic, I have resorted to JRSoftware's InnoSetup (Inno Script Studio because I'm Basic) to emulate an installer for me.

This pack includes:
The Same 10 Extra Clients.
Easy as 1, 2, 3!
Now can be installed manually with a .zip with all the files you need!
Over 50 new hat additions that work with 2007!
Over 300 New Splashes!
Old and New Features and Favorites!
Revamped Website!
No Password Required!
You can freely use this for anything!
Now Uses InnoSetup!

Changelog:

1.0
-Now Packed in a Installer that is Packed in a WinRAR Self Extractor so you don't have to manually install yourself. (thanks toast for coding and designing it)

3. Our Legal Notice

DjStuff is not affliciated with Bitl, ROBLOX, Graphicstoria, or any other buisness, person, logo, or project you may see.
Several Clients and Maps have been politely borrowed and used fairly.
They will be taken down at request of Bitl or esz.
If you have any issue with this, or you do not agree with these terms, you can DM me at xApril Birthdaysx#1921 (at the time of writing).
This is an early attempt to revive the content for the Original "Expansion Pack". The Original Installer Code was Maintained by Toast before the Split-up.
If you'd prefer to email me for buisness inquires, questions, or worries, you can do so at fnafhunter57@gmail.com.

4. Disclaimer

This is a "Manual" Installer, meaning you have to extract these files yourself into the same folder as your exe file with the ZIP, or Manually Direct it to your Novetus Folder in the exe installer. If you'd like me to add or take down your content, DM me on Discord or Email Me, and I will get back to you. All Content was Borrowed and Credited For, With Permission or Not.

5. Note

By Using this Expansion, you are agreeing to expand what is on your current Novetus Install with extra Hats, Clients, Maps, and Splashes. If you like not modifying your install, or you do not want to use this pack, You can delete this content and move on.

6. Errors (you also have a copy in the root folder)

-Hosting with the 2008 and 2010 GT3 Reskins Prevent others from Joining, even with port forwarding and UPNP enabled.
-2011E+ can't join 2011E servers, as Novetus' Security system prevents players from cross joining it, and due to different hashes and clientinfos.
-Studio Crashes in 2006LS and 2007S
-2011EM has stretched icons in places
-2009E is no longer needed due to the latest 1.2 snapshot
-2007S allows clothing, while the original RBXLegacy 1.18 version didn't.
-2014+ clients don't exist for the Built-in launcher yet.
-Hat/Clothing Customization is not availible for 2009M.
-2008L runs on 2009E's CSMP Functions, Providing SEVERAL Inaccuracies, such as Graphics or Engine.
-You have to manually back up your files incase something goes wrong.
-The Newer Installer is more laid back, meaning you have less limitations on installing it in a way
-The Uninstaller is a gamble to see if it uninstalls just the expansion pack files, OR Novetus' files as well
-If you uninstall with the built in installer, It will also uninstall ALOT of Novetus Hats (due to my laziness.)
-Hats and don't have descriptions yet.
